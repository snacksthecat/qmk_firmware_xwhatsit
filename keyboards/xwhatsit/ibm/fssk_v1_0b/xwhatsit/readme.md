A short description of the keyboard/project

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Purdea Andrei](https://github.com/purdeaandrei)
* Hardware Supported: Supports IBM Model FSSK v1.0b keyboards, using the original Xwhatsit model F rev. 1 or rev. 2 controller PCB.
Note: FSSK v1.0b was never officially released by i$, however the FEXT 1.0b board has been designed such that
if chopping it shorter no additional path cables would be required. This firmware supports such chopped boards.
Also tamsin is going to release a nicely modified FSSK v1.0b diptrace file too.
* Hardware Availability: Rare collector's item
